# Summary

These are some results for the NASA Bio X Geo manuscript where the goal is to look at the different patterns of biodiversity-geodiversity relationships across the different biodiversity flavors (alpha, beta, gamma * taxonomic, phylogenetic, functional). There are a lot of results here and it is a little bit complicated, so I would appreciate any feedback on what to focus on in terms of a story for the paper. I've tried to identify what I think is interesting and cool, but I would appreciate people's opinion on that.

# Methods

All these results are based on biodiversity and geodiversity variables aggregated at **50 km** radius. (I also did all of this at 100 km radius, but the results are very similar so I think it's fine to just stick with the 50 km radius for this story.) Also, all the geodiversity standard deviations are based on **5 km** pixel resolutions.

## Predictor variables (geodiversity)

I used variable selection as well as subjectively deciding which variables are important, to find eight predictors that encompass most of the environmental variation across BBS and FIA locations. You can see that there are a few variables that indicate the climate norms and the level of human impact inside the radius, as well as a number of variables indicating geodiversity or environmental heterogeneity.

* Means
  + Mean annual temperature
  + Mean annual precipitation
  + Mean human footprint index
* Standard deviations or variability measures
  + Standard deviation of elevation
  + Standard deviation of gross primary productivity
  + Standard deviation of precipitation
  + Shannon diversity of geological age category
  + Shannon diversity of soil type

## Response variables (biodiversity)

I fit a separate linear model for each biodiversity response variable, with the 8 variables above as predictors. There are 9 biodiversity response variables for BBS and for FIA, because we have 3 diversity levels (alpha, beta, gamma) and 3 diversity flavors (taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional). All of this is *incidence-based*, where species abundance is ignored and only presence-absence is taken into account. For FIA, I did run everything with abundance as well, but the results were qualitatively similar--I think it's better to just look at incidence for both birds and trees.

* Alpha diversity: local
  + *Taxonomic* (average richness of local communities in the radius)
  + *Phylogenetic* (average pairwise phylogenetic distance score of communities in the radius, *z*-score compared to null distribution so that it is independent of richness)
  + *Functional* (average pairwise functional distance score of the communities in the radius, *z*-score compared to null distribution so that it is independent of richness)
* Beta diversity: turnover
  + *Taxonomic* (average pairwise distance among communities in the radius)
  + *Phylogenetic* (average pairwise phylogenetic distance among communities in the radius; *z*-score compared to null distribution to get phylogenetic diversity independent of richness)
  + *Functional* (average pairwise functional distance among communities in the radius; *z*-score compared to null distribution to control for richness)
* Gamma diversity: regional
+ *Taxonomic* (total richness of pooled communities in the radius)
  + *Phylogenetic* (pairwise phylogenetic distance score of pooled communities in the radius, *z*-score compared to null distribution so that it is independent of richness)
  + *Functional* (pairwise functional distance score of pooled communities in the radius, *z*-score compared to null distribution so that it is independent of richness)

## Other processing of data

First, I got rid of any site within 50 km of the Canada or Mexico borders. Next, I had to get rid of a few outliers in beta diversity, but other than that all the data are included for BBS ending up with around 3000 sites. For FIA, I thinned out the data so that all plots were a minimum of 10 km from any other plot, to try to deal somewhat with autocorrelation and to make the models fit more quickly, which ends up with around 9000 sites. In addition, I threw out entire regions if there were less than 5 sites in the region because it isn't meaningful to estimate a random effect with so few points in the block. Luckily, that only got rid of a few dozen sites at most.
  
## Model fitting

I fit a mixed model in which there are fixed effects for all the predictors, and there is a random intercept and slope for each predictor in each region. The continental USA is broken up into regions so that we can look at how the coefficients of the relationships between geodiversity and biodiversity vary across space. The regions are helpful because it is much easier to fit a model with a small number of regions rather than continuous variation in the coefficients across space.

I fit the models with three different regions (and without regions) to see if the size and number of the regions made a difference in the relationships:

* *HUC4*: The HUC4 regions are based on watershed boundaries and divide the continental USA into about 200 regions.
* *TNC*: The Nature Conservancy ecoregions split the continental USA into about 70 regions.
* *BCR*: The Bird Conservation Regions split the continental USA into about 35 regions.
* *none*: To ensure that adding the regions isn't overfitting too much, I also fit the model with no random effect, just directly using the predictors as fixed effects.

The spatial autocorrelation among regions is modeled with a conditional autoregressive (CAR) structure. To specify that, I made an adjacency matrix where two regions are identified as being neighbors if they share a border. The random effect in the model now accounts for the spatial autocorrelation in the biodiversity values of neighboring regions.

I fit the model using the R package `brms` which let me fit it using Bayesian methods without having to fully specify everything about the model. I modeled all the error in the response variables as normally distributed except for taxonomic beta-diversity. Because no null model is run for taxonomic beta-diversity, it is still a raw dissimilarity metric varying between 0 and 1, so the error is beta-distributed.

## Cross-validation

I wanted to see how well the models do at predicting data outside the sample. I did 5-fold cross validation with the subsets stratified across regions: I refit each of the models on only 80% of the data five times, with the 20% holdout sampled evenly across the regions. This gives a "k-fold information criterion." I also used the model fits to predict the values for the other 20%. Then, I averaged the root mean squared error of those predictions to get a "k-fold RMSE" for each model, which tells us how well the model does at predicting data points that were not used to fit the model. The reason I used 5-fold and not the customary 10-fold is that since I used 5 as the cutoff for regions, 5-fold cross validation ensures that each 80% subset is stratified evenly across the regions. I also did the cross-validation for the model fit without random effects, as a proof of concept. In every case, the RMSE was divided by the range of the data to get a relative value that we can compare across response variables.

# Results

## Fixed effects

These are the coefficient estimates of the fixed effects. The predictors are scaled so that you can compare within a model. In the model performance plots the in-sample *rRMSE* is the black points and the k-fold *rRMSE* is the red points (r stands for relative meaning that the RMSE was divided by the range of the data so that model performance could be compared across different response variables). A low *rRMSE* is better predictive power, it can vary between 0 and 1 where 0 is no error. As you can see, the k-fold *rRMSE* is pretty similar to the in-sample *rRMSE* which is good and means that overfitting is not a big issue.

### BBS results

* If you compare the results for the different ways of breaking the USA into regions (HUC4, TNC, and BCR regions), it really looks like there isn't much difference. For the MS, I think we can focus on just one. TNC ecoregions seem to be a good choice because there are not too many of them and their boundaries have some ecological meaning.
* The RMSE plot validates our choice of including a random effect, since the model without it performs poorly whether in or out of sample. It also shows that geodiversity predicts the different forms of biodiversity more or less equally well.
* Climate effects (temperature and precipitation) have large impacts on bird diversity.
* Looking at the more geodiversity-related predictors, we see that variability of gross primary productivity is pretty strongly associated with increased taxonomic diversity across alpha, beta, and gamma, but it is associated with decreased taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity.
* For the geology and soil diversity relationships, we see that they have consistently positive impacts on gamma diversity, but more "geodiverse" areas are associated with lower alpha diversity, leading to reduced beta diversity even though gamma is higher. That is sort of interesting.
* Human footprint index mean actually has positive impacts on bird diversity across the board, at least for functional and phylogenetic diversity. 
* Elevation standard deviation is associated with higher beta and gamma diversity for taxonomic, but is associated with lower diversity of all kinds for phylogenetic and functional diversity.

### FIA results

* Overall, the uncertainty around the parameter estimates is higher than for BBS even though more data was used to fit the model.
* As with the BBS results, the RMSE plot shows that it is good to include a random effect. The difference is that beta diversity is poorly predicted compared to the other types of diversity.
* Elevation standard deviation, which we identified as a big component of geodiversity, consistently is asociated with higher beta diversity, as well as higher taxonomic gamma diversity.
* The climate predictors are pretty weak although precipitation has some effects on beta diversity.
* Human footprint index has little effect on tree diversity.
* Geological age diversity is associated with increased taxonomic diversity, and soil diversity seems like it has inconsistent effects.
* Productivity standard deviation is consistently associated with increased diversity of trees.

## Random effects

I made some maps to see if we could visualize any interesting patterns in the random effects, in other words, do the relationships vary across space? The patterns seem somewhat random for a lot of the predictors, although some patterns seem to appear for others. It is not really easy to say what is going on. I would think it's a better idea to just base the story around the fixed effects, but if people can help me think of a good story for the random effects, that would be great. The way I'm envisioning it now is to present the main results, then note on the side that we have to account for spatial variation in the relationships to see the overall pattern clearly.
